Here's a detailed breakdown of the Library Book Management System project in point form:

Project Overview: Library Book Management System

Core Objectives:
• Develop a comprehensive digital platform for library management
• Implement custom data structures and algorithms without using built-in C# libraries
• Demonstrate advanced software engineering and algorithmic skills

Key Features:
1. Book Management
• Add, update, and delete book records
• Track comprehensive book details (title, author, ISBN, genre)
• Support multiple book copies
• Categorize books dynamically

2. User Management
• Register and manage library member profiles
• Support different user types (students, faculty, staff)
• Track individual borrowing histories
• Implement user authentication

3. Borrowing System
• Implement book checkout and return processes
• Develop due date tracking mechanism
• Calculate and manage late fees
• Create reservation system for popular books

4. Advanced Search Capabilities
• Multi-criteria book search (title, author, genre, ISBN)
• Implement different search algorithms
• Enable advanced filtering options

Data Structures to be Used:
• Linked Lists for book collections and waiting lists
• Binary Search Trees for efficient searching
• Hash Tables for quick record lookup
• Priority Queues for managing reservations

Algorithmic Implementation:
• Sorting Algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort (by title)
  - Merge Sort (by publication year)
  - Quick Sort (by author name)

• Searching Algorithms:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
  - Hash-based searching

Performance Analysis:
• Compare time complexity of different sorting methods
• Analyze search algorithm efficiency
• Create performance visualization
• Document algorithmic strengths and limitations

OOP Principles:
• Abstraction
• Encapsulation
• Inheritance
• Polymorphism

Unique Selling Points:
• Custom-built data structures
• Comprehensive library management solution
• Algorithmic diversity
• Performance-focused design

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?
