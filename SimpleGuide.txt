Creating a Library Management System is an excellent way to showcase your skills in software engineering, algorithms, and data structures. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you start and systematically build your project:

---

### 1. **Project Planning**
   - **Break Down Features**:
     - Start with core modules like Book Management, User Management, and Borrowing System.
     - Gradually add advanced features like searching and performance analysis.
   - **Define Classes**:
     - `Book`, `User`, `Library`, `Borrowing`, and `Reservation` classes.
     - Use OOP principles for clear separation of concerns.
   - **Choose Data Structures**:
     - Linked List for book collections.
     - Binary Search Tree for efficient searching.
     - Hash Table for quick user lookups.
     - Priority Queue for reservation management.

---

### 2. **Set Up Your Project**
   - Open Visual Studio and create a **C# Console App** project.
   - Organize your files:
     - Separate classes into files: `Book.cs`, `User.cs`, `Library.cs`, etc.

---

### 3. **Implement Basic Functionality**
   - Start with Book Management:
     - Create a `Book` class with properties like `Title`, `Author`, `ISBN`, `Genre`, and `CopyCount`.
     - Implement a Linked List to manage the book collection.
     - Write methods for adding, updating, and deleting books.
   - Test the methods with a simple menu-driven console interface.

---

### 4. **Expand to User Management**
   - Create a `User` class with properties like `UserID`, `Name`, `UserType`, and `BorrowHistory`.
   - Implement registration and user tracking using a Hash Table.
   - Add authentication logic.

---

### 5. **Add Borrowing System**
   - Develop `Borrow` and `Return` functionalities.
     - Track due dates and calculate late fees.
   - Use Priority Queues to manage reservations.
   - Ensure real-time updates to book and user records.

---

### 6. **Implement Search Algorithms**
   - Add a search function in the Library class.
   - Use:
     - Linear Search for unsorted data.
     - Binary Search for sorted data (e.g., by ISBN).
   - Test advanced filters (e.g., combining title and author criteria).

---

### 7. **Enhance with Sorting Algorithms**
   - Implement sorting methods in the Library class:
     - Bubble Sort for titles.
     - Merge Sort for publication years.
     - Quick Sort for author names.
   - Test their efficiency using sample data.

---

### 8. **Analyze and Optimize Performance**
   - Compare the time complexity of algorithms by measuring execution time.
   - Create a simple report or console visualization.

---

### 9. **Final Touches**
   - Ensure the application is modular and follows OOP principles.
   - Handle edge cases (e.g., non-existent books or users).
   - Add user-friendly console prompts.

---

### 10. **Documentation**
   - Write a detailed report explaining:
     - Data structures and algorithms used.
     - Time complexity analysis.
     - Project design and challenges.
